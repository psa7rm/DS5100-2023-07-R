# Agile Development

## Backstory

Agile development is essentially a **philosophy** developed in response to **bureaucratic** software development processes.

It is an approach that focuses on the realities of software:

- **Individuals and interactions** over **processes and tools**
- **Working software** over **comprehensive documentation**
- **Customer collaboration** over **contract negotiation**
- **Responding to change** over **following a plan**

Essentially, it is based on a **mistrust** of machines, plans, contracts, documents, etc.

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) was written in 2001 after a number of lighter and more flexible approaches were developed in the 1990s.

- SCRUM
- XP (Extreme Program)&nbsp;
- Etc.

It is also a collection of **methods and tools**:

- User stories
- Scrum meetings
- Sprints
- Task weighting with cards
- Etc.

Agile is also **counter-cultural**, like many of the software movements that attended the rise of the web.

## Principles

Here are the 12 Principles of Agile SD:

1. Customer satisfaction by **early and continuous delivery** of valuable software. &rarr; The "early and often" of open source development.

2. **Welcome changing requirements**, even in **late** development.

3. Deliver working software **frequently** (weeks rather than months).

4. Close, **daily** cooperation between business people and developers.

5. Projects are built around **motivated individuals**, who should be **trusted**.

6. **Face-to-face** conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).

7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.

8. **Sustainable** development, able to maintain a constant pace.

9. **Continuous** attention to technical excellence and good design.

10. **Simplicity**&mdash;the art of maximizing the amount of work not done&mdash;is essential.

11. Best [architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_Architecture), requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing** teams.

12. Regularly, **the team reflects** on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.

As you can see, it's all about **giving teams the freedom and trust** to creatively respond to client needs and change.

## Aside

As an aside, it's worth noting the effect of the Web on these developments.

- Agile was spurred by the **affordances of the Web** and **open source software**
- And for teams to **organize organically**,&nbsp;without the oversight of governmental bodies or corporations
- Influenced by the success of Open Source tools like **Linux**
- Consistent with **Git** as a tool for organically organizing software development.
